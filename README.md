The most profitable film genres are action and adventure. 




Conclusions




Next steps:

We would suggest using Nielsen, the global leader in audience insight, data, and analytics to pull additional data and futher examine the television and film landscape. The datasets that the team had access to were limited and based on publicly available datasets. 

Further analysis of film studios, production companies, top producers, directors, and talent should be made to ensure Microsoft Film's first film has the production and creative talent talent needed for success.

In addition, to ensure better accuracy of data we would suggest using IMBD API (Amazon Web Server) and Nielsen data to pull additional data sets to examine the film, television, and media landscape to ensure the investment in making a box office film is the most lucrative for the business.
