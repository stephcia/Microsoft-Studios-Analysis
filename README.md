## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
Microsoft has decided to launch Microsoft Studios as a way to tell the stories of their larger brand and it's subsidaries. As part of this pursuit that have decided to contract us to conduct an exploratory data analysis and extract valuable business insights for internal stakeholders, production and creative teams. From our research from our given datasets and indepdently sourced findings, we have come to make three data backed recommendations to strongly enter this competitive market with effective strategy.

## Business Problem

As a new division it’s important for Microsoft Films to establish Market Credibility and bring a net positive ROI to itself and the larger organization. There concerns are:

What are the variables to making a highly profitable and overall successful film?
From initial research we found Microsoft is in the process of a major acquisition of a game studio called, Activision/Blizzard, recognizing the opportunity for multi-platform growth (Video Games, Series and Movies) we set out to understand:

Is there enough engagement to justify creating a video game franchise, if so which?
Which Genre is the most successful? Are there any specific subgenres we could use to increase marketability?
What is the style the content should be written in (rated G to R)? What runtime best keeps people engaged?

## Next steps:

The datasets employed for our analysis were pulled from publicly available sources, and do not include cross-platform measurement data. In this regard, we recommend the utilization of Nielsen, a leading global provider of audience insight, data, and analytics, to obtain additional data and gain deeper insights into the television, film, content and digital landscape. 

To succeed, Microsoft Studio must maintain exceptional creative standards and collaborate with talented individuals capable of producing original and captivating narratives. To this end, executives spearheading the studio's efforts should allocate significant time and resources towards recruiting a robust team of production executives, thereby establishing the studio for optimal success. It is imperative to seek out exceptional talent from major studios and production companies, with a focus on top-tier producers, directors, and writers who possess in-depth industry knowledge.

Furthermore, we recommend conducting thorough research on Microsoft's intellectual property portfolio and revenue streams to evaluate the feasibility of implementing multi-platform strategies that can complement the production of film and television content.
