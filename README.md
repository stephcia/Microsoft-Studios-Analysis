## Conclusions:


- **Content/IP** - Microsoft should utilize its extensive portfolio of popular video game intellectual property to create content. Specifically in conjuction with their newest acquision of Activision/Blizzard, Microsoft will make up approximately 28% of all viewers on Twitch, one of the top 5 major live streaming platforms, Microsoft is positioned to significantly enhance its market share in the video game space.

- **Genre** - Based on the analysis of the top-grossing film genres spanning from 1915 to 2022, it is advisable that Microsoft Studios focuses on utilizing their intellectual properties to produce Action-Adventure Films, which have historically been the most lucrative genres. This approach is likely to result in maximum profitability for the company.

- **Ratings & Runtime** - To optimize their market share and appeal to a wide audience, Microsoft should produce a film with a rating falling within the G to PG-13 range. Also supported by the evidence is that microsoft film studios should structure it's content to have a runtime of 120 to 160 to have the highest success and box office earnings. 



## Next steps:

The datasets employed for our analysis were pulled from publicly available sources, and do not include cross-platform measurement data. In this regard, we recommend the utilization of Nielsen, a leading global provider of audience insight, data, and analytics, to obtain additional data and gain deeper insights into the television, film, content and digital landscape. 

To succeed, Microsoft Studio must maintain exceptional creative standards and collaborate with talented individuals capable of producing original and captivating narratives. To this end, executives spearheading the studio's efforts should allocate significant time and resources towards recruiting a robust team of production executives, thereby establishing the studio for optimal success. It is imperative to seek out exceptional talent from major studios and production companies, with a focus on top-tier producers, directors, and writers who possess in-depth industry knowledge.

Furthermore, we recommend conducting thorough research on Microsoft's intellectual property portfolio and revenue streams to evaluate the feasibility of implementing multi-platform strategies that can complement the production of film and television content.
